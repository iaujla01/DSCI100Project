    "## Introduction\n",
    "   A pulsar is a Neutron star, remnants from a supernova explosion. Pulsars are characterized by their blinking light or periodic pulse of radio waves, rapid rotation, and strong magnetic field(Cofield, 2016 ). Because these are among the densest materials on Earth, Physicists study these to identify the presence of alien planets, detect gravitational waves, calculate cosmic distances, and test the universal force of gravity. Moreover, when two pulsars are nearby, there will be a collision and a larger explosion (Mahony, 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "   Each potential detection is represented by two curves:  the integrated profile and DM-SNR. Since a pulsar periodically emits unique pulses, the integrated profile is used to represent an average of these different pulses (Lyon, 2016). To describe the uncertainty caused by dispersion (where each pulse is detected at different times across frequencies), a dispersion-measure-signal-to-noise (DM-SNR) curve is used. Furthermore, each curve is described by four statistical variables: mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, and skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In reality, most candidates are caused by radio frequency interference and noise, consequently making positive pulsar cases rare to detect. Hence, our goal for this project is to train a model that classifies whether a star is non-pulsar or pulsar star based on the mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, and skewness of the integrated profile. Our central question is:  can we determine whether the signal is coming from a pulsar star or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "   To explore this, the group will analyze a total of 17,898 radio pulses by the High time Resolution Universe Survey (HTRU) by Dr. Robert Lyon of the Royal Astronomical Society. \n",
